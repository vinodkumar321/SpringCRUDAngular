   <h2> Body Shape</h2>
The penguin's body is adapted for swimming. Its body is fusiform (tapered at both ends) and streamlined. A penguin has a large head, short neck, and elongated body.
The tail is short, stiff, and wedge-shaped.
The legs and webbed feet are set far back on the body, which gives penguins their upright posture on land.
